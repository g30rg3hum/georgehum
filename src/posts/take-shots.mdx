I'd like to share "a way of life" that I have personally found extremely fulfilling. I go to bed satisfied, having directed my days in this manner.

This approach involves simply "taking shots" at your goals and desires daily. It's super straightforward, but there are layers of reasoning to why it works.

This mindset means detaching yourself from the outcome, and purely focusing on just repeatedly hammering shots at whatever it is you're trying to achieve. The thing is, positive outcomes are never truly guaranteed, no matter how much work you put in or how confident you may feel about it. Particularly, if you're really trying and pushing your limits, failures and mistakes are inevitable. While we know that, they are nonetheless discouraging by nature - often deterring us from continuing any further. However, it is by continuing that we can even make any progress. Concentrate on taking more shots until you accomplish your goal. Nevermind the previous shots that didn't go in, or whether your next shot will.

"Taking shots" also means repetition and persistence. I cannot think of an experience where I never saw improvements after doing it multiple times. Naturally, you begin notice more effective ways to go about it. Keep going. You're guaranteed to get better.

There is also the sense of fulfillment that comes with it. Everyday involves fighting for what you want, and that's seriously awesome. My worst days happen when I don't take any shots towards any of my goals/desires. I'm not trying to sound corny - it's genuinely soul-crushing.

Finally, notice how I don't describe the kind of shots to take. They don't have to be perfect. I experience and see this time and time again. Inaction is often attributed towards perfectionism, but it's taking action that will actually create any sort of progress. If you don't do anything, nothing will happen. Crazy, right? Just look to take the shot - the sun doesn't have to be shining, and you don't have to bang it dead on. **By taking the shot, you:**

- **have taken action (absolutely essential for any real change/advancement to happen)**
- **are less affected by failures and mistakes (they will happen)**
- **are guaranteed to be closer to your goal overtime (by repetition)**
- **end your days feeling fulfilled**
