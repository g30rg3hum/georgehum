More so like a starter post than anything super informative. I'm thinking of posting more on X, with the concept of "building in public" trending currently. It also enables me to express myself more and build more of a personality/presence online. However, there is a need to balance this with blog post content, as I don't want to just copy content over onto here.

Having discussed the concept of sk8er with many friends and as well as local skaters, it seems to be a very viable idea, and something I'm looking forward to scaling and fully embedding into skate culture in the long run. I'm currently the only developer for now, focusing on shipping an MVP by the end of the year at the latest. Feel free to contact me if you want in - I could definitely use some additional man-power. Apologies as you'd have to reach out to me manually for now. I'll be looking to add commenting, subscription to the blog, and overall more structure to solidify this blogging venture a bit further.

I do love to write and express myself - I need to establish what topics I want to share about on here, and it would be cool to also monetize this on the side as well somehow. I'm particularly really into coding, mindset shifts, skating, food, and fitness. These will be likely the main things I write about on here, and as well as on X. I will be focusing on posting more on here and X, and perhaps extending more onto Instagram later on (which I think is a bit more entertainment-content focused rather than providing real value and information, which I'm focusing on right now).

Perhaps a blog post a week - my priority is in shipping this MVP out into the world.

More to come!
